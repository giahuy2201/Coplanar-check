# Coplanar-check
The program is made to check if 3 points in 3-dimension space are coplanar

# Usage:
 - Compile the cpp file to get the excutable file $ g++ coplanar.cpp -o coplanar
 - Excute the file $ ./coplanar
 - Type 2 initial points
 - Type the third point to check
 
 The program will output the the x and y calculate from 2 intial points. If it outputs "TRUE", these point are coplanar, else, they are not.
